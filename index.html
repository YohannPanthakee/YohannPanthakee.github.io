                        Hello! My name is Yohann Panthakee, and I am an aspiring motorsports engineer with a passion for Design Engineering. Welcome to my online portfolio. This website allows me to share my work with others and keep visitors informed about my current initiatives. I appreciate you coming, and I'm excited to show you my work!

                        <p align="justify">
                        My passion for design began when I was studying for my A-levels and evolved throughout the years until I started my master's program. I've worked on various projects over this time some of which are shown in the projects section below. My understanding of approaching a complex assembly has improved with each finished project. My master's group design project required me to lead the design engineering team and all this effort prepared me for that. Designing an endurance racing bike in CATIA V5 while working with a group of 11 other engineers and exchanging requirements in a short amount of time promoted efficiency and included deliberation, planning, modification that drove a successful end product like real-world motorsport. <a href="Files/Images/GDP Render 1.png" target="_blank" class="fa fa-image" aria-hidden="true"></a> <a href="Files/Images/GDP Render 2.png" target="_blank" class="fa fa-image" aria-hidden="true"></a>

                        I am currently working on a unique and exciting project that involves developing a fully electric car to break the Nurburgring lap record. The plan is to convert the vehicle into a hydrogen fuel cell to enter LeMans in 2027, where a new hydrogen category has been introduced. Although the position is not paid, it is a great opportunity to get involved in such an exciting project. So far, I have led the development of an exhibition-scale model of our PERRINN 424 car and coordinated our exhibitor's stand at Autosport International 2024. Currently, I am working on creating a custom driving simulator to validate our driver position. I have already produced a technical specification and drawing of our current driver position. I am now in the process of evaluating the feasibility of the project by conversing with suppliers.

                    <p align="justify">
                        During my internship, I was involved in several innovative projects that required a combination of creative thinking and engineering skills to tackle various challenges. My duties included the reverse engineering of 3D scans, creating models of components from complex technical drawings, and designing solutions based on client briefs. I completed all my assigned tasks ahead of schedule, which allowed me to assist the other engineers on the team by creating technical drawings for them and gathering important measurements and data.

                    <p align="justify">
                        The idea for the project originated from Virtuosi Racing, who wanted to investigate using the onboard camera to gather valuable data. As a result, I suggested using deep learning image segmentation to localise the car laterally on the track in a manner that resembles the output of a GPS module in a given local coordinate frame. I created a deep neural network, an image dataset, unique training visualisation metrics, and a script to take a video as input and generate a graph of lateral position for the project.

                        While it was my second year participating in the Formula student competition, the COVID restrictions were still in effect. Therefore, most of the year was spent working on software. My primary responsibilities were improving the previous year's CNN model to better reliably and confidently recognise the cones. In addition, the strategy for each dynamic event was created as part of my undergraduate thesis and later implemented. When our team finally gained access to the vehicle two weeks before the competition, I immediately began prepping for the track and taking control of the physical testing of the car.

                    I participated in the Formula Student AI competition for the first time this year. When I first joined, I intended to get involved in the software design process. The computer vision system, notably the cone detection algorithm, attracted my interest the most. I first created my own Python software to use colour thresholding to identify the cones, which developed into creating a CNN to localise cones in the image. I participated in the online static events, co-authoring and presenting in nearly all presentations; however, since COVID measures were in place, the competition was suspended and was held online.

I collaborated closely with my supervisor during this internship to handle client tickets. After spending the first week studying the program, I was given a set amount of tickets to try duplicating each day. For a software issue to be resolved, I would submit it to the developers. I would also create a test plan if a new bug were discovered. In addition to my daily tasks, I studied mechanical design to pass the solidworks exams.

                    Through this work experience, I have applied myself inside the automotive engineering team to tackle problems before new automobiles hit the assembly line. During my tenure there, I worked on various hands-on and computer-based duties, including designing mock components using CATIA V5  for the 3D printer and installing them on the test mule car. In addition, I disassembled numerous sub-assemblies and commented on the procedure to potentially improve the workflow.

                    This work experience exposed me mainly to the uses of Matlab/Simulink in the development of vehicles. My most significant contribution to the project was some code I modified to change some of the output figures for their internally designed drive cycle car simulation. In addition, I asked for some training in Simulink as I had never used it before. As a result, I created a home heating system model with the assistance of the engineers on my team, which helped me learn the fundamentals of model-based design.

                    This work experience put a stronger emphasis on design and production procedures. I used CATIA V5 to model the wing structures, notably the stingers and ribs. This was my first exposure to technical drawings and how they convey information for wing manufacturing. Finally, I witnessed destructive and non-destructive testing of wing structures and the tests used to ensure the viability of new components and designs.

In addition, I mastered the fundamentals of 3D modelling and progressed to modelling a pinion shaft. While on the simulation side, there was also an introduction to the simulation setup procedure and a rudimentary grasp of the typical simulation outcomes.
